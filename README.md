# Simple Pi Approximator

Baised on the Gregory Leibniz Series (pi = 4 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9...)
I might implement the Nilakantha series later.
Also able to do multithreading by precising the number of jobs.

## Usage

```bash
# to run
cargo run --release -- backend number of iterations jobs
# to get help
cargo run --release -- help
```
